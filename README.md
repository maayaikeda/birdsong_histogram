These are song recording from two birds recorded with SAP (Sound Analysis Pro). The column names are modified from orignal SAP output and columns are added to describe the recording. 
Bird 1 was recorded with his family (mate and babies) and comments section were filled based on what other sounds were in the file.
Bird 2 was recorded either alone (no one else in the cage) or with a female. For bird 2, all the songs recorded when he was alone was considered "undirected" songs. Recordings were labeled "interact" when female calls could be heard while the male bird was singing.

The analysis shows that when (male) birds are singing alone or to himself, the songs are longer/slower than when they are singing while the female birds are making calls. It is known that female-directed songs are shorter/faster than undirected song. This current analysis suggest that when males are singing over the female calls, they are singing directed songs.
